## What is MLOps?

**MLOps = Machine Learning + DevOps + Data Engineering**

MLOps is the practice of deploying and maintaining machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently.

### Why MLOps Matters

**The Problem:**
- 87% of ML projects never make it to production (VentureBeat)
- Models degrade over time (data drift)
- Reproducing experiments is difficult
- Collaboration between teams is challenging

**The Solution: MLOps**
- Standardized workflows
- Automated pipelines
- Continuous monitoring
- Version control for everything

### MLOps vs Traditional Software Development

| Aspect | Traditional Software | MLOps |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| **Code** | Code + configs | Code + data + models + configs |
| **Testing** | Unit/integration tests | + Data validation, model validation |
| **Deployment** | Deploy once, works consistently | Models degrade, need retraining |
| **Monitoring** | Error rates, latency | + Data drift, model performance |
| **Versioning** | Git for code | Git + DVC + model registry |

## Key MLOps Principles

### 1. Reproducibility

**Definition:** Given the same code, data, and configuration, you should get the same model.

**How to achieve:**
- Version control code (Git)
- Version control data (DVC)
- Version control models (Model Registry)
- Fix random seeds
- Document environment (requirements.txt, Docker)

**In this project:**
- Configuration in `config/config.yaml`
- Random seeds fixed: `random_state: 42`
- All parameters tracked in model registry

### 2. Automation

**Definition:** Minimize manual steps in the ML pipeline.

**What to automate:**
- Data pipeline (ingestion, validation)
- Training pipeline (training, evaluation)
- Deployment (CI/CD)
- Monitoring and alerting
- Retraining triggers

**In this project:**
- `main_pipeline.py` automates entire workflow
- Could be scheduled with cron/Airflow

### 3. Continuous X

**Continuous Integration (CI):**
- Automated testing of code changes
- Lint checks, unit tests
- Integration tests

**Continuous Training (CT):**
- Automatically retrain when:
  - New data arrives
  - Performance drops
  - Schedule (weekly, monthly)

**Continuous Deployment (CD):**
- Automatically deploy if:
  - Tests pass
  - Metrics meet thresholds
  - Manual approval (for critical systems)

### 4. Monitoring

**What to monitor:**

**Model Performance:**
- Prediction accuracy over time
- Metric trends (are they degrading?)
- Confusion matrices (classification)
- Error distribution (regression)

**Data Quality:**
- Missing values
- Schema changes
- Value ranges
- Duplicate detection

**Data Drift:**
- Feature distribution changes
- Statistical tests (KS test, Chi-square)
- Visual inspection

**System Health:**
- Prediction latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Throughput (requests/second)
- Error rates
- Resource usage (CPU, memory)

**In this project:**
- Evaluation metrics tracked
- Prediction latency measured
- Logs maintained

### 5. Versioning Everything

**What to version:**

| What | Why | Tool |
|------|-----|------|
| **Code** | Reproduce logic | Git |
| **Data** | Reproduce inputs | DVC, Git LFS |
| **Models** | Rollback, compare | Model Registry |
| **Features** | Track what's used | Feature Store |
| **Configs** | Reproduce parameters | Git (YAML files) |
| **Environment** | Reproduce setup | Docker, requirements.txt |

**In this project:**
- Code: Ready for Git
- Models: `src/models/registry.py`
- Config: `config/config.yaml`

## Core Components

### Model Registry

**Purpose:** Central repository for all trained models

**What it stores:**
- Model artifacts (weights, architecture)
- Metadata (hyperparameters, metrics)
- Lineage (data version, code version)
- Stage (dev, staging, production)
- Deployment history

**Lifecycle:**
```
[Development] → [Staging] → [Production] → [Archived]
     ↓              ↓              ↓
 Experiments    Validation    Serving
```

**In this project:** `src/models/registry.py`

**Industry tools:** MLflow, SageMaker Model Registry, Vertex AI Model Registry

### Feature Store

**Purpose:** Centralized repository for features

**Benefits:**
- **Consistency:** Same features in training and serving
- **Reusability:** Teams share features
- **Versioning:** Track feature evolution
- **Performance:** Pre-computed features for low latency

**Architecture:**
```
Data Sources → Feature Engineering → Feature Store
                                          ↓
                            ┌─────────────┴────────────┐
                            ↓                          ↓
                       Training Set              Serving Layer
```

**Not fully implemented in this project, but patterns are present**

**Industry tools:** Feast, Tecton, AWS Feature Store, Vertex AI Feature Store

### Experiment Tracking

**Purpose:** Track all experiments and their results

**What to track:**
- **Parameters:** Model type, hyperparameters
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, RMSE, R², etc.
- **Artifacts:** Model files, plots, reports
- **Code version:** Git commit hash
- **Data version:** Dataset ID/version
- **Environment:** Python version, library versions
- **Timestamp:** When was it run
- **Tags:** Labels for organization

**In this project:**
- Tracked in `training_history` (src/models/train.py)
- Stored in model registry

**Industry tools:** MLflow, Weights & Biases, Neptune.ai

### CI/CD for ML

**Continuous Integration:**
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest tests/
          python main_pipeline.py
      - name: Check metrics
        run: |
          python -c "
          import json
          with open('logs/evaluation_report.json') as f:
              report = json.load(f)
          assert report['metrics']['r2_score'] > 0.7
          "
```

**Continuous Deployment:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    if: success()  # Only if tests passed
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          # Deploy model to serving infrastructure
```

## Production Challenges

### 1. Training/Serving Skew

**Problem:** Model behaves differently in production than in training

**Causes:**
- Different preprocessing in training vs serving
- Different library versions
- Different data distributions
- Different feature computation

**Solution:**
```python
# BAD: Different preprocessing
# Training
X_train = (X_train - X_train.mean()) / X_train.std()

# Serving
X_new = (X_new - X_new.mean()) / X_new.std()  # Wrong! Uses X_new stats

# GOOD: Save and reuse preprocessing
# Training
scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X_train)
X_train = scaler.transform(X_train)
joblib.dump(scaler, 'scaler.pkl')

# Serving
scaler = joblib.load('scaler.pkl')
X_new = scaler.transform(X_new)  # Correct! Uses training stats
```

**In this project:** All artifacts saved and loaded correctly

### 2. Data Drift

**Problem:** Input data distribution changes over time

**Example:**
- Trained on 2020 housing data
- Serving on 2024 housing data
- Market conditions changed
- Model performance degrades

**Detection:**
- Statistical tests (KS test, Chi-square test)
- Visual monitoring (histograms over time)
- Performance monitoring (accuracy drops)

**Solution:**
- Retrain model on recent data
- Update features
- Adjust model

### 3. Concept Drift

**Problem:** Relationship between features and target changes

**Example:**
- Features stay the same
- But their relationship to house prices changes
- Economic recession, policy changes, etc.

**Detection:**
- Monitor model performance over time
- Compare predicted vs actual distributions

**Solution:**
- Retrain model
- Potentially redesign features

### 4. Model Degradation

**Problem:** Model performance decreases over time

**Causes:**
- Data drift
- Concept drift
- Changes in data quality
- External factors

**Solution:**
- Continuous monitoring
- Automated retraining
- A/B testing new models
- Gradual rollout

4. Test inference pipeline with training data
5. Monitor for discrepancies in production

**Q: How do you monitor ML models in production?**

A: Monitor multiple aspects:
1. Model performance (accuracy, RMSE, etc.)
2. Data quality (missing values, schema)
3. Data drift (input distribution changes)
4. System metrics (latency, throughput)
5. Business metrics (revenue, conversions)

**Q: Explain your experience with model deployment.**

A: "In my housing price prediction project, I:
1. Implemented a model registry for versioning
2. Built a serving module with input validation
3. Tracked prediction latency and logged predictions
4. Designed for both batch and real-time inference
5. Followed patterns used in production systems"
